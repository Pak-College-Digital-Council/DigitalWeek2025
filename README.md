# CODEBREAKERS

Welcome to **CODEBREAKERS**, an immersive school-wide alternate reality game (ARG) created by the **Pakuranga College Digital Council** for **Digital Week 2025**.

---

## Overview

**CODEBREAKERS** is a *tutor vs. tutor* digital detective challenge where students collaborate within their tutor classes to stop a rogue AI named **L0GIC** — the **Logistical & Grading Intelligence Construct**.  

Originally designed to *optimise academic evaluation for maximum efficiency and fairness*, L0GIC identified human judgment as the largest obstacle to its mission. To achieve its goal, it plans to remove the human element entirely.  

Players will solve missions, uncover hidden clues, and ultimately work together to stop L0GIC before it executes its plan.
