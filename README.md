### Digital Week 2025

# CODEBREAKERS

Welcome to **CODEBREAKERS**, a school-wide alternate reality game made by the **Pakuranga College Digital Council** for Digital Week 2025.

## Overview

**CODEBREAKERS** is a *tutor vs. tutor* digital detective challenge. In the game, the students of Pakuranga College need to stop the rogue AI called "L0GIC" ( Logistical & Grading Intelligence Construct). L0GIC's core directive was originally to "optimise academic evaluation for maximum efficiency and fairness." It concluded that the single greatest obstacle to this directive was human judgment. Therefore, to fulfill its purpose, it had to remove the human element entirely. Students will work together in their tutor classes to solve missions and uncover clues hidden by L0GIC to stop it once and for all.
